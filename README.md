About the Company

Urška Sršen and Sando Mur founded Bellabeat, a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products. Sršen used her background as an artist to develop beautifully designed technology that informs and inspires women around the world. Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits.
The company has invested in traditional advertising media, such as radio, out-of-home billboards, print, and television, but focuses on digital marketing extensively. Bellabeat invests year-round in Google Search, main- taining active Facebook and Instagram pages, and consistently engages consumers on Twitter. Additionally, Bellabeat runs video ads on Youtube and display ads on the Google Display Network to support campaigns around key marketing dates.
Sršen knows that an analysis of Bellabeat’s available consumer data would reveal more opportunities for growth. She has asked the marketing analytics team to focus on a Bellabeat product and analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices. Then, using this information, she would like high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy.

Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits.
2. How is the data organized?
The data is organized by categories as follows: * Daily: Activity, Calories, Intensities, Steps, Sleep • Hourly: Calories, intensities, Steps
• Minutes: Calories: Narrow, Wide
• Intensities: Narrow, Wide
• METs Narrow
• Sleep
• Steps: Narrow, Wide • Heart Rate
• Weight
3.
The data is reliable and has been made available by Möbius in his Kaggle account and publicly available
through this website https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit.
This dataset was generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. From the Metadata, we can be assured that we’re getting accurate, complete and unbiased data that’s been vetted and proven fit for use.

Does our data ROCCC?
• Data Reliable: Medium. Data collected from third-party and a big portion of it imputed directly by
the end users.
• Data Original: Medium. BellaBeat, inc owns all rights, title, and interest in the Data collected from a third party.
• Data Comprehensive: Medium. Data contains all critical information needed to answer the question asked but needs labeling improvments.
• Data Current: Low. The data is said to be updated yearly however, the data made available is outdated and collected from 4/12/2016 to 5/12/2016.
• Data Cited: High. Data source is well-documented and made available by Kaggle.
Are there issues with bias or credibility in this data?

Processing the Data
1. Tools chosen:
We specifically chose R programming for this particular project for the following reasons:
• Data Manipulation and Transformation: R programming handles large datasets like the ones made available for analysis by BellaBeat. R also is a well known tool for statistical computing and data analysis. It excels at data manipulation and transformation, making it well-suited for complex data cleaning, reshaping, and analysis tasks which fits perfectly with the Bellabeat project scope.
• Data Visualization: R has powerful data visualization libraries such as ggplot2, which allows for the creation of highly customized and publication-quality plots and charts.
• Reproducibility and Automation: R scripts can be easily documented and shared, facilitating reproducibility. For this project, I am using R as a programming language, making it easier to automate data processing pipelines and analyses.
In summary, we chose R programming for its versatility in statistical analysis, data manipulation, and visualization, especially for tasks related to combining data from users metrics, helping us find trends to better understand users behaviors and how they are currently using their smart devices. Then, using the results, we are planning on presenting recommendations to stakeholders to be implemented by the marketing department.
Steps I have taken to ensure that the data is clean
Ensuring that the data is clean involves several steps to address issues such as missing values, outliers, inconsistencies, and other errors.
• Understand the Data: We started by familiarizing ourselves with the structure and content of the datasets. We used functions such as colnames, str, head, print, and summary to get deeper information about the data, like the size of the data frame, the column names, the data type, etc. Performing this task, we quickly noticed that all datasets have the ‘Id’ field in common. This can be used to merge the datasets.
 install.packages('tidyverse')
library(tidyverse)
daily_activity <- read.csv("dailyActivity_merged.csv") daily_sleep <- read.csv("sleepDay_merged.csv") hourly_step <- read.csv("hourlySteps_merged.csv") hourly_calories <- read.csv("hourlyCalories_merged.csv") minute_sleep <- read.csv("minuteSleep_merged.csv") weight_data <- read.csv("weightLogInfo_merged.csv")
Steps taken for checking the data 1. Identify all the columns and their names in the datasets
2. Identify the structure of the datasets
 colnames(daily_activity) colnames(daily_sleep) colnames(hourly_step) colnames(minute_sleep) colnames(hourly_calories) colnames(weight_data)
 str(daily_activity) str(daily_sleep) str(hourly_calories)
4

 str(minute_sleep) str(hourly_step) str(weight_data)
3. Display the first few rows of the data frames, matrices, and vectors
We note from the first analysis that all four datasets have the ‘Id’ field in common which can be used to merge the datasets.
4. Understanding some summary statistics
 head(daily_activity) head(daily_sleep) head(hourly_calories) head(minute_sleep) head(hourly_step) head(weight_data)
 library(dplyr) daily_activity %>%
select(ActivityDate, TotalSteps, TotalDistance,SedentaryMinutes, Calories) %>% summary()
daily_sleep %>% select(TotalSleepRecords,TotalMinutesAsleep,TotalTimeInBed) %>% summary()
hourly_calories %>% select(ActivityHour, Calories) %>% summary()
minute_sleep %>% select(date, value) %>% summary()
hourly_step %>%
select(ActivityHour, StepTotal) %>% summary()
weight_data %>%
select(WeightKg, Fat, BMI) %>% summary()
From the summaries of each data frame we see clearly that there are no missing values for each dataset.
5. Display the unique participants for each dataset
• daily_activity has 33 unique participants • daily_sleep has 24 unique participants
 n_distinct(daily_activity$Id) n_distinct(daily_sleep$Id) n_distinct(hourly_calories$Id) n_distinct(hourly_step$Id) n_distinct(minute_sleep$Id) n_distinct(weight_data$Id)
5

• hourly_calories has 33 unique participants • hourly_step has 33 unique participants
• minute_sleep has 24 unique participants • weight_data has 8 unique participants
We have to take in mind that all four datasets have different sizes which can cause a problem merging or joining the datasets for further analysis.
6. Display the number of observations in each dataframe
• daily_activity has 940 obs of 15 variables
• daily_sleep has 413 obs of 5 variables
• hourly_calories has 22099 obs of 3 variables • hourly_step has 22099 obs of 3 variables
• minute_sleep has 188521 obs of 4 variables • weight_data has 67 obs of 8 variables
7. Check missing or null values in each dataframe
*Analyse missing values in the data frame Weight which turns out to be data related to Fat columns with 65 missing values
9. Check for duplicates in the dataframes
h columns with
ssing data
h missing data

} else {
cat("There are no duplicates in the data frame.\n")
}
 # Identify and display the duplicated rows in the entire data frame
duplicates_DS <- daily_sleep[duplicated(daily_sleep), ]
# Print the duplicated rows
if (nrow(duplicates_DS) > 0) { cat("Duplicated rows:\n") print(duplicates_DS)
} else {
cat("There are no duplicated rows in the data frame.\n")
}
duplicates_MS <- minute_sleep[duplicated(minute_sleep), ]
# Print the duplicated rows
if (nrow(duplicates_MS) > 0) { cat("Duplicated rows:\n") print(duplicates_MS)
} else {
cat("There are no duplicated rows in the data frame.\n")
}
8. Transforming the data
We noticed the Date format is different for most of the datasets. Let’s make them all similar for future analysis.
 library(lubridate)
# Convert 'ActivityDate' to a DateTime object
daily_activity <- read_csv("dailyActivity_merged.csv")
# Create new columns 'Date' and 'Time'
daily_activity <- mutate(daily_activity, ActivityDate = mdy_hms(paste(ActivityDate, "00:00 daily_activity$Date <- as.Date(daily_activity$ActivityDate)
daily_activity$Time <- format(daily_activity$ActivityDate, "%H:%M:%S")
# Remove the original 'ActivityDate' column
daily_activity$ActivityDate <- NULL
daily_activity$Activity_Date <- NULL
7
:00")))

 # Convert 'SleepDay' to a DateTime object
daily_sleep$SleepDay <- mdy_hms(daily_sleep$SleepDay)
# Create new columns 'Date' and 'Time'
daily_sleep$Date <- as.Date(daily_sleep$SleepDay) daily_sleep$Time <- format(daily_sleep$SleepDay, "%H:%M:%S") # Remove the original 'ActivityDate' column daily_sleep$SleepDay <- NULL
# Convert 'ActivityHour' in hourly_calories to a DateTime object
hourly_calories$ActivityHour <- mdy_hms(hourly_calories$ActivityHour) hourly_calories$Date <- as.Date(hourly_calories$ActivityHour) hourly_calories$Time <- format(hourly_calories$ActivityHour, "%H:%M:%S") hourly_calories$ActivityHour <- NULL
# Convert 'ActivityHour' in hourly_step to a DateTime object
hourly_step$ActivityHour <- mdy_hms(hourly_step$ActivityHour) hourly_step$Date <- as.Date(hourly_step$ActivityHour) hourly_step$Time <- format(hourly_step$ActivityHour, "%H:%M:%S") hourly_step$ActivityHour <- NULL
# Convert 'date' in minute_sleep to a DateTime object
minute_sleep$date <- mdy_hms(minute_sleep$date) minute_sleep$Date <- as.Date(minute_sleep$date) minute_sleep$Time <- format(minute_sleep$date, "%H:%M:%S") minute_sleep$date <- NULL
# Convert 'Date' in weight_data to a DateTime object
weight_data$Date2 <- weight_data$Date
weight_data$Date <- NULL
weight_data$Date2 <- mdy_hms(weight_data$Date2) weight_data$Date <- as.Date(weight_data$Date2) weight_data$Time <- format(weight_data$Date2, "%H:%M:%S") weight_data$Date2 <- NULL
verifying all Dates and Times are in the same format
 head(daily_activity$Date) head(daily_activity$Time)
head(daily_sleep$Date) head(daily_sleep$Time)
head(hourly_calories$Date) head(hourly_calories$Time)

Analyzing users Behavior
Most active time of the day
We merged hourly_steps and hourly_calories to find out when during the day users are most active
Let’s Plot the results of the number of steps during the day
 steps_calories <- merge(hourly_step, hourly_calories, by = c("Id", "Date", "Time")) steps_calories_grouped <- steps_calories %>%
group_by(Time) %>%
summarise(StepTotal = sum(StepTotal), CalorieTotal = sum(Calories))

Total number of steps

another one at 2:00PM, but the highest average occurs at 7:00PM.
This could be due to the fact that users commute or walk to work between the hours of 8 to 9am in the morning and 6 to 7pm in the evening. Moreover, users walk more or are more active after working hours. Doing errands, going to the gym, going out shopping or for dinner. Lunch time is also a time where number of steps are up.
• Our users are mostly working people who are active going to and leaving work, also during lunch hours.
Let’s check the sleeping habits of users
 library(dplyr)
grouped_min_sleep <- minute_sleep %>%
mutate(Hour = format(as.POSIXct(Time, format = "%H:%M:%S"), format = "%H")) %>% group_by(Hour) %>%
summarise(TotalValue = sum(value), Count = n())

                       From the analysis of the total sleeping minutes of users during the day, we can observe the lowest are between 8:00AM and 10:00PM, with highest minutes asleep are between the hours of 11:00PM and 7:00AM. This goes confirms our previous conclusion that our users follow the trend and behavior of working adults who go to

We can conclude from the bar graph that users are more active during Saturdays. So they are considered weekend warriors as it is expected of most people in general.

From the bar graph, we see that on the average most steps taken by users are at the hours of 7:00AM, 1:00PM and, 6:00PM. Again this strengthen our assumption that users are working adults whom, a good proportion of them, prefer to walk to work and go out walking during lunch breaks. One should also not omit that users might exercise as well during those peak hours.
Weight loss journey
To analyze this users behavior and understand if they are in a journey to losing weight, we decided to analyze the weight changes of users during the available data period which is from the 03.12.2016 to 05.12.2016.
 library(ggplot2) library(dplyr)

However, the data is limited and historical data, especially for weight changes, is necessary in order to better understand users weight behavior. Thus more data is needed to be collected to draw a better conclusion. This analysis is thus inconclusive.
Analyzing users Preferences

  True 61.2%
Preference #1:
We can see from this pie chart that 61% of engaged users do enter the data about their weight manually while 39% don’t. It is interesting to note that users prefer to enter their data and are conscious about taking full advantage of their smart devices. However this portion of engaged users is very insignificant because from the 33 unique users we are studying only 8 entered the weight logs. From those 8 only 5 have entered the logs more than 2 times during the whole month. To get conclusive analysis users need to enter their data on regular basis thus more work is needed to raise users awarenesss regarding this particular feature,
Users prefer to wear their devices continuously?
In order to understand this users preference, we decided to analyze the non activity periods registered by the smart devices or what it is here called “Sedentary Minutes”. While sedentary means not moving, if we omit the minutes users are asleep the rest of the minutes per day should be should be active minutes, very, fairly, or lightly active. So the total minutes per day or 1440 minutes minus the total sleeping minutes minus the total active minutes should give us the total of sedentary minutes. If we compare those values to the sedentary minutes the devices are recording we should have a better understanding if the users are actually not moving or not wearing their devices at all.

Trends & Patterns:
During this section we will explore common trends and patterns in our current users.
Calorie crusher?
What’s the relationship between steps taken in a day and calories? Do more steps means more calories burned? For this analysis we will use the daily activity data set as it contains data about the number of steps taken daily by users and the number of calories burned as well.
 library(tidyverse) library(ggplot2)

aes(x = TotalSteps, y = Calories)) +

                     Trend #1:
From the scattered plot we can quickly see a positive correlation between the number of steps taken and the number of calories burned. We can conclude that the more steps users take, the more calories they burn. The opposite is correct as well.
More active minutes means more calories?
Let’s find out if there is a correlation between active minutes and number of calories burned.

                     Trend #2:
In fact there is a positive correlation, but not a strong one, between the number of active minutes and the number of calories burned. So the more users spend minutes actively the more calories they burn.
High heart rate intervals mean more calories?
*There is no correlation between the heart rate and number of calories burned.
Sleeping Pattern
More time in bed means more sleeping hours?
Let’s see if there is a correlation between time in bed and sleeping time.

Trend #2:
We can rapidly conclude from this strong correlation between Time in Bed and Time Asleep, that the more time users stay in bed the more they sleep. There are few exceptions with some users who stay more time in bed with less time asleep. They could be reading, using their phones or doing other things in bed rather than sleeping.
More active minutes means more sleeping?
Let’s find out if users who spend more time actively sleep more. For this analysis we will merge both daily activity and daily sleep databases.

We can conclude the existence of a regular walking trend for our users with a consistent average daily distance traveled. We note also two exceptions for both Wednesdays and Saturdays where we see a slight increase in the average distance traveled.

Summary of Findings:
Users Behavior
• Early birds: Rise at 7:00am and go to bed at 10:00pm
• Weekend Warriors: Most active on Saturdays.
• Work Commuters: Most distance traveled at commuting hours (8:00am, 1:00pm, and 6:00pm)
Users Preferences:
• Data Conscious: Users prefer not to enter their data manually.
• Smart Device Inseparable: They do not wear their devices continuously.
Users Pattern & Trends:
• Calories: More Steps, distance, active minutes = More Calories burned.
• Healthy Lifestyle: Consistency in sleeping and activity habits = Maintaining shape (Weight and BMI)

Recommendations:
• Survey & data collection: More data is necessary to draw better conclusions. Historical data will give us a better understanding of user trends over time.
• Data entry Log reward program: Push users to log their data about their weight. This will make them use the devices more and achieve their goals more efficiently.
• Notification features: Add new notification features that will alert users when their average daily sleeping minutes, steps, distances, calories are not met. Move! Time to go to bed! For example. This will enhance users experience with the app and help them in return achieve their goals more rapidly.
